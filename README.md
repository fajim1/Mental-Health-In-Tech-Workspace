# Mental-Health-In-Tech-Workspace
Analyzed and visualized attitudes towards mental health in tech firms by preprocessing and extracting a OSMI 2016 survey; visualized results to increase awareness of current statistics 

# Motivation
This project was performed as part of my introduction to data mining course. The requirement for this project was to find a sizeable dataset and perform Pre-processing and EDA. 



# Data Source

This dataset is the 2016 OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey.
Currently over 1400 responses, the 2016 survey aims to measure attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace, and examine the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers.
